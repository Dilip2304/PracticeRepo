<!-- Paragraphs -->

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

<!-- Line breaks -->

This is the first line.  

And this is the second line.


<!-- Emphasis -->

<!-- bold -->
I just love **bold text**.

I just love __bold text__.

Love**is**bold

<!-- Italic -->

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

A*cat*meow

<!-- both bold and italc -->

This text is ***really important***.

<!-- blockquotes -->

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood

<!-- Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest. -->

<!-- Adding Title -->

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

<!-- URLs and Email Addresses -->
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

<!-- Formatting Links -->
To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks in the brackets.
